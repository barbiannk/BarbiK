To showcase my software design & engineering skills, I have worked on enhancing my zoo monitoring system that was designed in Java. 
This taught me how to implement and use loops, arguments, and variables by incorporating .txt files. I liked the idea of this project,
because I learned about including required packages and designing a system by following a set of standards & guidelines, 
by designing the layout for the end user. This project also taught me the importance of commenting code properly, to write code in a clean and precise manner, 
implementing if/else statements, and how to compile and run Java code. 
The enhancements I made allowed for me to rewrite the code, which allowed me to see bugs that I could correct, and also a buffer overflow issue. 
The end result is a clean and nicely commented code, with one additional feature added to the “main menu”.
